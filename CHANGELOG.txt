~

1.00.110

1.00.109 
Merged fix for choppy animations on hidden gobs.
Fixed large map not saving size setting.
Fixed animal path toggle not working.
Think I fixed a Movable caused crash bug when taking roads.
Restored amber-like flowermenus by default. Can be reverted to new format in UI settings.
Added "QuickMenus" option to ui settings, speeds up flowermenu closing after a selection is made. On by default.
~

1.00.108 
Major Changes:
Merged with Boshaw for the below items:
Changed flowermenu appearance, no it's not a toggle option.
Added custom flowermenu for objects, accessible by holding alt and right clicking.
Added "Delete" to alt right click menu. Delete differs from hide such that deleting an object causes the game to never consider loading it, thus no minimap icon, no hitbox, no alarms, etc. This feature is specifically for things that you literally just NEVER care to ever see cluttering your screen again, such as cave moths. 
You can manage your deleted gobs/objects through the "Game Windows" selection and "Deleted" icon. You've been warned about what delete does, don't delete shit like bears and then complain you're getting wrecked by a ghost. 
To interact with things in the world without triggering flowermenu auto selections, hold control now.
Added custom highlight/party highlight (only for ArdClient/Sloth Client)/hide/alarm in custom flowermenu.
Skybox is now a video setting toggle that's off by default. No longer a memory leak, but likely still does have a negative performance impact overall. 
Moved item lock to Shift + Control + Right click, to allow ctrl right clicks to be used to disable flowermenu auto selections.
Added another keybind, Shift+H by default, to toggle hide on individual objects. Ctrl H is still the default to bulk hide.
Added Carts to the list of things that the pick forage item (Q by default) will interact with if closest to you. Can be disabled in Control settings.
Added "Gob Spawner" window that can be accessed through "Game Windows" on the menugrid, and used to spawn animals. Let me know if I left any animals out, I'll work on adding individual poses later but for now only bears trolls mammoths whales and nidbanes have some additional poses.

Minor Changes:
Added "default" list to alert/hide/highlight for easy selection.
Shortened and flattened underground wall tiles.
Switched a bunch of display settings over the new and improved color selector. Most color changes require a game restart to take effect.
Added a slider to general settings to set the autodrink threshold %.
Made ameter public to assist with getting it's value from pbot scripts.
Enabled Loftar's "Toggle mine supports" button in menugrid under toggles, this one will work for towercaps.
Removed right click on minimap moving unless your right click lands on a gob. 
Added a toggle to new alerts window to only alarm once, while NOT selected the same mob/object can alarm more than once if it goes off screen and back into view again.
Added 2 new options to "combat settings" to force fight session focus, one will only force focus if the chat box does not have focus (ie you're typing) the other will force fight session focus no matter what, meaning that keybinds will always be sent to the combat UI and also fixing the default client bug where if you reload the client in combat you might be unable to use moves.
Added option to display settings to shorten palisade and brick wall segments, ie - flat walls. 
Toggle chat keybind will now no longer hide chat, only restore it if it's already hidden - because MightySheep is a whiny little cunt.
Added moles to alarm/hide list.
Added a setting to audio settings to turn down the "door" volume when entering/exiting buildings. 
Added volume slider to audio settings to turn down the "ding" sound from inspecting trees, and toggling most features.
Added new toggle to general settings to alert on new wounds and the damage from them. Can be disabled, on by default.

Botting changes:
Merged all of Purus' new botting API changes, pathfinder, and auto tableware remover. 
Depreciated PBotAPI, please use haven.purus.pbot.PBotUtils instead. There was no reason to attach the constantly updating GUI to two different botting API's. 
Readded removed Purus "Nashorn" functionality to run side by side with the new. Two separate PBot script lists now, one for the new api and one for Nashorn scripts. To run a depreciated nashorn script, change the file extension to ".PBotOld" You will also need to change the API reference in your nashorn scripts to PBotUtils instead of PBotAPI
The updater will now also download new scripts when added, feel free to send me your PBot scripts if you'd like them distributed and credited to yourself. 
~

1.00.107
Moved Game Windows and Combat Decks buttons to the end of menugrid.
Merged another loftar siege change, to make siege claims on by default.
Reverting chat window minimize until I figure out a cleaner way to do it, if you close chat you can reopen via game windows in the menugrid.
~

1.00.106
Partial rollback on change to fight session to remove the part that ensures it always has focus. Evidently this interferes with the chat window and other text boxes, who knew? Kept the part where it'll draw over everything else.
Added folder with 5 buttons inside to menugrid to switch combat decks. TEST THIS IN SPARS PLEASE
Added moose alarm/dropdown.
Added Dewy Lady's Mantles to alarm list.
Added separate toggle to UI settings to only disable magic menugrid hotkeys.

Added "Korund" to boulder and minable stone list.
Redesigned "off target" combat ui to make it smaller and the position more logical. 
Stripped out some fluff from fight session, no longer attempting to calculate enemy defense weight/agility. Might re-add later when I have time to do it properly.
Added wild horse alarm. Off by default, select an alarm to enable.
Various loftar merges for the new sieging autism they're thinking about doing.
~

1.00.103
Implemented Ender's expanded craft database, alt X by default.
Made clicks on the bottom right menugrid not click through if you click a blank spot.
~

1.00.102
Moved buff icons down a tad so that horse energy bars don't block them.
Added another mob type to try to elevate the other animals if they die in water. Let me know if it works/doesn't/if I forgot one.
Added autodrink option to general settings. Really not sure how I feel about this one, off by default. Triggers at <80% stamina and should fire at most once per 3~ seconds. Open to feedback. Turn it off if it gives you issues, and given that it's a new feature I don't advise having it on during pvp and such. 
Added toggle in UI Settings to stack cupboard windows on top of eachother instead of staggering.
Fixed claim toggle buttons not working on the first press when you log in.
~

1.00.101
Fixed large map zoom indicator not updating when using mousescroll.
Think I finally fixed large map movequeue zoom offset/drawing.
Rewrote/optimized "EquipWeapon" script. Will now find all weapons in inventory and belt and prioritize Sword>Battleaxe>Axe. Will do nothing if a Sword/Battleaxe is already equipped, and should no longer end with something stuck on your mouse cursor. 
Fixed hide quest panel on login toggle not working. Quest window can be reopened if hidden by selecting a quest from your character window.
Added "EquipSacks" script that will attempt to equip up to 2 traveler sacks or bindles.
Added a registry entry for your :hz setting, changing max foreground fps will now save between relogs.
Log village chat to discord option is now character specific, and fixed the bug that was preventing every message from being transferred. Seems to work now.

Added 5 new keybinds for belt page switching, default alt1 - alt5.
Fixed crash issue with miner alert and roads.

Added "Medlar" trees to tree list.
Fixed minimap closing if you hit escape with it focused.
Converted livestock manager over to a resizable window, going too narrow will hide buttons, but can make the window shorter in general now.
Slight change to how windows save position, mostly this allows containers to not open on top of eachother making it easier to see contents.
Switched quest helper window over to the window type that saves position and can be locked.
Added toggle to "Control settings" to disable pick forage keybind from opening/closing gates.
Fixed livestock manager not working for languages other than English
Large update to translation file adding new labels/button strings for translation.
Broke out horses from "hide animals" toggle into their own "hide horses" toggle.
Changed proximity aggro to not target domestic horses. 
Merged boshaw change to make certain windows "hideable." Selecting this button on the window will make the frame and background transparent unless the window has your mouseover focus. Currently the list is quest log, belt, and minimap. Accepting ideas for more windows to add this functionality to. Button looks horrible on default theme, not sure what to do about that - Belt caption doesn't have enough space.
Added boshaw change that elevates mob types 5 points if theyre in water. Should make everything easier to pick up except foxes.
Added treatment display for midge bites.
~

1.00.96
Merged with Boshaw, who added locks to hotkey bars. Locked will allow you to drop things onto the bar, but not move/remove them.

Added quest helper window, alt Q by default.
Made textentry boxes ignore keypresses including ctrl and alt so that keybinds will continue to work.
Toggle chat keybind will now hide chat if chat has focus, unhide chat if its hidden, and focus chat if unhidden but not focused. Should be a cleaner way to interact with it.
Numpad hotbar when in "Grid" style will now match the layout of the actual numbpad. Let me know if this causes new issues.

Hand slots widget now displays equipped quality.

Merged some outdated wound stuff.
Maybe fixed unbound keybinds triggering from anything. This could potentially have other implications I guess? Let me know if anything weird happens.
Added debug crash write outs to the client folder to help with troubleshooting. They simply write the stacktrace in a text file that can be sent or copied to me whenever.

Publicized flax bot and the improved pepper bot, go nuts. Fuck Jorb. Flax bot is best used on wide open fields with lots of empty barrels, by a farmer with crawl speed left on 24/7. Will continously harvest flax, replant highest quality, and barrel leftover seeds generating near-infinite animal fodder while also raising flax quality continuously.
Added toggle to disable village idol smoke.
Added toggle to disable steel crucible smoke (I don't know if this works, I don't have steel crucibles.)

Fixed a bug where shield checker would keep reporting full shield values even if disconnected from the game. Should now send a message to Discord saying it disconnected and turn off the bot.

Added a discord disconnection alert to steel bot.
Fixed a null pointer crash using eat all.
"Eat all" will now output the total stats gained by all the food eaten, has a built in 1 second "lag" to give the server time to update your stats - that's intended.

Steelbot has attended some communication courses, and will now warn you in Discord if he is running low on fuel (<5 stockpiles left) and automatically shut down if he runs out of fuel.
