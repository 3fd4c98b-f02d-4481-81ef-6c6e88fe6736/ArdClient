Added functionality to the Purus Farmer bot when doing trellis harvest for pepper. You can now use the select container button to select an exquisite chest that the script will go empty it's inventory of pepper into before going back to harvesting.

I set the chest upbetween two long rows and use a second character to empty the chest into barter stands while the bot runs.
Changed slime alert to syslog append instead of error to stop the constant error sound every 10 seconds.
