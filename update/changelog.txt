1.00.135
Added jellyfish to cluster picking options.
Fixed minimap toggle to highlight mirkwood logs not working.
Fixed changing radius colors breaking some other overlays.
~

1.00.134
Fixed steel refueler using the wrong pathfinder and causing a crash due to it.
Restructured menu settings so that you can mousewheel scroll the automatic selection list once again. Moved Cattail Head/Root autodrop to general settings near the mining autodrop options. 
Reverted Oven/Smelter filler to old pathfinder. 
~

1.00.133
Added toggles to "Menu Settings" to autopick clustered Gooseneck Barnacles and Cattails, and a toggle to autodrop Cattail Roots/Heads (Only keep Fibres) 
Added total LP per curio to study desk window. 
Potentially fixed quest pointer locations being incorrect on questgivers at extreme Z elevations with disable elevation turned on. 
Added two toggles to "Miner Alert" to warn about and automatically stop in-progress mining if a mine support is detected <= 13 tiles from the player at <50% HP or <25% HP depending on the selected toggle. Currently only tested on wood supports, but should work for all. The auto-stop fires off the player having a current mining pose, so I don't know that you can bet your entire life on it. Will trigger every 5 seconds while in range of the damaged support if the toggle is enabled (the update frequency of miner alert itself.)
Added toggles to UI Settings to enable/disable the purus PBot menugrid buttons. 
Added a color selector to display settings to change the color of the garden pot finished overlay. Will require client restart to change.
~

1.00.132
Fixes for accuracy and speed on farmer stockpiling.
Fixed pick forage keybind not triggering multi picks for oysters.
~

1.00.131
Fixed charter secrets not showing up in charters and portico windows. 
Alt right click will no longer open the alternate flower menu if holding a visible item on your cursor. If you're someone who wants to abuse running with a bucket of water or something, use alt H to toggle the visibility and the alt menu will work again. 
Fixed the equipory not updating your image when equipment changes.
Fixed for Destroyer bot.
~

1.00.130
Merged a few more boshaw things:
Dead animals are now static, meaning they use next to no rendering resources in the client. 
Added toggle to "video settings" to "Disable Animations" Which will turn all gobs with animations static greatly reducing the resources spent rendering them. The downside to this is they look mildly ugly walking around due to lack of animations, but it is a very notable FPS boost when toggled on.
Fixed a bug making sketchbooks unusable to change building materials.
~

1.00.129
Fixed a literal 1 in a billion bug where hitting char select with a dead character that died while moving would crash the client due to the UI not being created yet (Why Loftar, why?)
Various fixes to Oven/Smelter filler bot. Switched over to new pathfinder. I don't use this much, so let me know what issues it has and I'll work on them.
Put a pathfinder left click in farmer stockpiling to navigate around stockpiles before picking up more stuff to stockpile.
~

1.00.128
Added toggle to "UI Settings" to enable the new detailed mouseover tooltips, for people who hate change and information. Detailed tooltips are now off by default.
~

1.00.127

PLEASE START USING THE NEW UPDATER, IT'S LITERALLY BETTER IN EVERY WAY. Will self heal corrupted files and only download when there's an update. Also faster.
http://tinyurl.com/y29vdsjb

Changes:
Fixed a bug where windows could become clickgrabs if toggled to hidden while dragging/clicking it.
Added some logic to a few of the Xtensions that should allow them to exit if the window is closed.
Switched over to Boshaw's pathfinder, scripts still use purus for now, much faster and more accurate. Please note that you can't pathfind to a place that isn't visible/loaded yet. Default keybind to toggle pathfinding is still Ctrl Z, feel free to play around with it and give feedback.
Merged Amber minimap zoom feature. 
Added Boshaw's detailed info tooltips when doing shift/mouseover with resource info toggled on.
Your movement speed is now displayed in the upper right if you have "show fps' toggled on.
Fixed the infamous loftar alt tab bug where alt tabbing while moving the camera would make every UI element clickthrough.
~

1.00.126
Small fix to PBotWindows so they'll acknowledge being closed and can be closed to stop scripts early.
~

1.00.125
Tiny fix to farmer.
~

1.00.124
Added function sendDiscordMsg(String channel, String text) to PBotUtils, can be used in conjunction with the Discord API to send messages to connected channels ingame. 
Added function "logout" to PBotUtils to exit straight to the login screen, also added the discord disconnects to both PBotUtil logout functions. 
Fixed a bunch of sound alerts having jumbled audio to them.
Added a bunch more audio alerts from various games - thank Omnipotent, not me. 
Removed the alarm path from the sound manager for most alarms, should only display the alarm name now.
Changed the old PBotMenu to hotkey "N" instead of "P" so it doesn't conflict with the new one. 
Moved gob spawner hotkey to "R" so it doesn't conflict with alerted. Search and  Study still conflict on S, unsure which one to move. Open to suggestions.
Worked on Destroyer bot a bit, can be used to mass destroy dirt stockpiles for example.
Added boshaw's Avatar mouseover details. Disabled by default, can be enabled in Display settings. Mousing over the picture of someone in your friend's list, and other various places, will show you a list of the equipment they are wearing. 
~

1.00.123
Fixed a couple typos in the new farmer stockpiler that would've prevented it from working, I'd previously only tested with flax.
Fixed minimap move clicks not clearing the active movement queue. 
Added overlay coloring to garden sheds, on by default, can disable via display settings. Uses the same colors/logic that cupboards do. 
Fixed a crash hitting the "pick foragable" button while taking a road.
Removed what appears to be another memory leak being caused by kinned/memoed player circles. Party circles and personal circle still persist using the default Amber logic.
~

1.00.122
Switched a couple UI widgets over to weak references to help with garbage collection inbetween sessions.
Swapped "Select" and "Load Defaults" buttons on Sound Manager, to make it more clear that the select button is part of confirming an alarm selection from the middle list. 
Switched the gui being fed to Discord away from the session gui, seems to solve a memory leak with persisting objects when switching characters if Discord is turned on. 
Added Amber's toggle to bottom of general settings to "drop soil," will simply drop any soil that you pick up into your inventory.
~

1.00.121
Fixed shift left click not doing infinite-move on minimap anymore.
Due to above, movement queing through minimap is now the same as in the world, hold alt and left click.
Fixed being sometimes unable to pick up scents if disable elevation was turned on.
Fixed livestock manager "drop" options not clearing when the window is closed. 
Added a warning to farmer that you must select your crop area before your stockpile area.
Removing wound alert, may readd later, not super sure how to stop it from announcing treatments besides a big list of all of them to ignore.
Fixed softcap in craft window not updating when changing gear.
~

1.00.120
Fixed memory leak being caused by Alerted system persisting through character switches.
Added millet to farmer, assumed it finishes at the same stage barley/wheat does - let me know if that's wrong.
Turned off pathfinder debugging, woops.
Coracle script will now stop movement after dropping coracle into the water.
Added auto stockpile selector to Farmer, still very much in beta, shouldn't crash your game but it also might not stockpile correctly.
~

1.00.119
Quick update - added a few retrys to Farmer to account for lag and such that will cause it to get stuck on various "waiting for something" steps.
~

1.00.118
Fixed drink changes not working for alternate belt window.
~

1.00.117
Fixed flowermenus intercepting mouse clicks while closing.
Deleted outdated Gemstone class.
Fixed typo causing alabaster to not be flagged on minimap.
Fixed a few PBot scripts and switched the drink function to PBot default. PBotUtils.Drink(true)/PBotUtils.Drink(false) now to utilize. 
~

1.00.116
Fixed gob hp toggle adjusting the wrong saved value.
~

1.00.115
One more fix for farmer and a fix for flaxbot. 
~

1.00.114
Fixed farmer, still seems to be doing something weird when planting - will look into it.
~

1.00.113
Removed a large portion of the change log from +50 versions ago to decrease file size.
Fixed poppycaps and ghost pipes not showing growth stages.
Fixed coracle script again. 
Added opium dragon minimap icon, it's large like irrlights to get your attention.
Getting rid of "quick menus" - doesnt seem to actually speed anything up in testing. 
~

1.00.112
Fixed the non-selected flowermenu options not disappearing immediately. 
Added cauldrons to the "do not shift right click" menu as an option.
Sped up block chopper, will speed up the rest of the "spam right click" xtensions over time.
Rewrote some flowermenu logic, "Quick Menus" under UI settings will now cause autoselect options to not even open a flower menu. Functionality wise, this changes next to nothing over basic amber functionality because if you had an autoselect and the action was instant, you still had no way to stop it. Auto selections via this method will output what they autoselected to the "System" log as an FYI. This is obviously turned off by default.
As a result of the above change, using the drink hotkey will no longer pop up a flower menu at all. 
Switched the default value of the pick foragable keybind picking up/dropping carts to false. Can be enabled in control settings if so desired.
Fixed dismount xtension still using old gob.knocked function. 
~

1.00.111
Added local resource nodes to load default alerts button - also removed wild horses.
Fixed a different but similar issue ignoring personal player paths. 
Fixed skybox toggle logic being backward.
Fixed gobspawner using the wrong res for "Chicks" causing a crash.
Added another null check in that should prevent the player paths causing crashes on roads. 
~

1.00.110
Converted the new "Flat Caves" into a toggle, off by default. Can be enabled in display settings underneath flat walls. 
~

1.00.109 
Merged fix for choppy animations on hidden gobs.
Fixed large map not saving size setting.
Fixed animal path toggle not working.
Think I fixed a Movable caused crash bug when taking roads.
Restored amber-like flowermenus by default. Can be reverted to new format in UI settings.
Added "QuickMenus" option to ui settings, speeds up flowermenu closing after a selection is made. On by default.
~

1.00.108 
Major Changes:
Merged with Boshaw for the below items:
Changed flowermenu appearance, no it's not a toggle option.
Added custom flowermenu for objects, accessible by holding alt and right clicking.
Added "Delete" to alt right click menu. Delete differs from hide such that deleting an object causes the game to never consider loading it, thus no minimap icon, no hitbox, no alarms, etc. This feature is specifically for things that you literally just NEVER care to ever see cluttering your screen again, such as cave moths. 
You can manage your deleted gobs/objects through the "Game Windows" selection and "Deleted" icon. You've been warned about what delete does, don't delete shit like bears and then complain you're getting wrecked by a ghost. 
To interact with things in the world without triggering flowermenu auto selections, hold control now.
Added custom highlight/party highlight (only for ArdClient/Sloth Client)/hide/alarm in custom flowermenu.
Skybox is now a video setting toggle that's off by default. No longer a memory leak, but likely still does have a negative performance impact overall. 
Moved item lock to Shift + Control + Right click, to allow ctrl right clicks to be used to disable flowermenu auto selections.
Added another keybind, Shift+H by default, to toggle hide on individual objects. Ctrl H is still the default to bulk hide.
Added Carts to the list of things that the pick forage item (Q by default) will interact with if closest to you. Can be disabled in Control settings.
Added "Gob Spawner" window that can be accessed through "Game Windows" on the menugrid, and used to spawn animals. Let me know if I left any animals out, I'll work on adding individual poses later but for now only bears trolls mammoths whales and nidbanes have some additional poses.

Minor Changes:
Added "default" list to alert/hide/highlight for easy selection.
Shortened and flattened underground wall tiles.
Switched a bunch of display settings over the new and improved color selector. Most color changes require a game restart to take effect.
Added a slider to general settings to set the autodrink threshold %.
Made ameter public to assist with getting it's value from pbot scripts.
Enabled Loftar's "Toggle mine supports" button in menugrid under toggles, this one will work for towercaps.
Removed right click on minimap moving unless your right click lands on a gob. 
Added a toggle to new alerts window to only alarm once, while NOT selected the same mob/object can alarm more than once if it goes off screen and back into view again.
Added 2 new options to "combat settings" to force fight session focus, one will only force focus if the chat box does not have focus (ie you're typing) the other will force fight session focus no matter what, meaning that keybinds will always be sent to the combat UI and also fixing the default client bug where if you reload the client in combat you might be unable to use moves.
Added option to display settings to shorten palisade and brick wall segments, ie - flat walls. 
Toggle chat keybind will now no longer hide chat, only restore it if it's already hidden - because MightySheep is a whiny little cunt.
Added moles to alarm/hide list.
Added a setting to audio settings to turn down the "door" volume when entering/exiting buildings. 
Added volume slider to audio settings to turn down the "ding" sound from inspecting trees, and toggling most features.
Added new toggle to general settings to alert on new wounds and the damage from them. Can be disabled, on by default.

Botting changes:
Merged all of Purus' new botting API changes, pathfinder, and auto tableware remover. 
Depreciated PBotAPI, please use haven.purus.pbot.PBotUtils instead. There was no reason to attach the constantly updating GUI to two different botting API's. 
Readded removed Purus "Nashorn" functionality to run side by side with the new. Two separate PBot script lists now, one for the new api and one for Nashorn scripts. To run a depreciated nashorn script, change the file extension to ".PBotOld" You will also need to change the API reference in your nashorn scripts to PBotUtils instead of PBotAPI
The updater will now also download new scripts when added, feel free to send me your PBot scripts if you'd like them distributed and credited to yourself. 
~

1.00.107
Moved Game Windows and Combat Decks buttons to the end of menugrid.
Merged another loftar siege change, to make siege claims on by default.
Reverting chat window minimize until I figure out a cleaner way to do it, if you close chat you can reopen via game windows in the menugrid.
~

1.00.106
Partial rollback on change to fight session to remove the part that ensures it always has focus. Evidently this interferes with the chat window and other text boxes, who knew? Kept the part where it'll draw over everything else.
Added folder with 5 buttons inside to menugrid to switch combat decks. TEST THIS IN SPARS PLEASE
Added moose alarm/dropdown.
Added Dewy Lady's Mantles to alarm list.
Added separate toggle to UI settings to only disable magic menugrid hotkeys.
Switched pclaim/vclaim/kclaim toggles over to new settings system and reverted the toggle buttons back to Amber-like.
Hitting the X on the chat window will now minimize it to a small bar rather than closing it.
Added "bruh" and "noperope" alarms.
~

1.00.105
Study table total mental weight is now unique mental weight, not additive. 
Fixed new CraftDB helper label resizing the window to fit.
~

1.00.104

Fixed crash bug if you mouseover quest pointer while taking a road.
Made inventory lock icon smaller.
Fight session will now always have focus and draw over everything else.
Added windmills to "hide houses" toggle.
Added some query instructions to craft database window.
Added "Korund" to boulder and minable stone list.
Redesigned "off target" combat ui to make it smaller and the position more logical. 
Stripped out some fluff from fight session, no longer attempting to calculate enemy defense weight/agility. Might re-add later when I have time to do it properly.
Added wild horse alarm. Off by default, select an alarm to enable.
Various loftar merges for the new sieging autism they're thinking about doing.
~

1.00.103
Implemented Ender's expanded craft database, alt X by default.
Made clicks on the bottom right menugrid not click through if you click a blank spot.
~

1.00.102
Moved buff icons down a tad so that horse energy bars don't block them.
Added another mob type to try to elevate the other animals if they die in water. Let me know if it works/doesn't/if I forgot one.
Added autodrink option to general settings. Really not sure how I feel about this one, off by default. Triggers at <80% stamina and should fire at most once per 3~ seconds. Open to feedback. Turn it off if it gives you issues, and given that it's a new feature I don't advise having it on during pvp and such. 
Added toggle in UI Settings to stack cupboard windows on top of eachother instead of staggering.
Fixed claim toggle buttons not working on the first press when you log in.
~

1.00.101
Fixed large map zoom indicator not updating when using mousescroll.
Think I finally fixed large map movequeue zoom offset/drawing.
Rewrote/optimized "EquipWeapon" script. Will now find all weapons in inventory and belt and prioritize Sword>Battleaxe>Axe. Will do nothing if a Sword/Battleaxe is already equipped, and should no longer end with something stuck on your mouse cursor. 
Fixed hide quest panel on login toggle not working. Quest window can be reopened if hidden by selecting a quest from your character window.
Added "EquipSacks" script that will attempt to equip up to 2 traveler sacks or bindles.
Added a registry entry for your :hz setting, changing max foreground fps will now save between relogs.
Log village chat to discord option is now character specific, and fixed the bug that was preventing every message from being transferred. Seems to work now. 
~


1.00.100
Added 5 new keybinds for belt page switching, default alt1 - alt5.
Fixed crash issue with miner alert and roads.
Reversed window saving logic over to only ignore saved position for "Cupboard" currently, so multiple can be opened without stacking.
~

1.00.99
Quick commit to remove the shift 1-5 belt change, will move to keybinder.
~

1.00.98
Changed feast table and study desk logic over to pull translated local strings, should now work for languages other than English.
Added some more items that need translated to language file.
Switched windows back to pulling in translated values instead of hard coded english. 
Please let me know what bots or features don't work because of using a language other than English so I can fix them.
~

1.00.97
Switched map loading logic again to fix slowed map loads caused by an attempt to fix follow cam not finding a z axis coordinate to snap to. 
Added total mental weight required to study desk printout.
Readded using shift 1-5 to go through the first 5 pages of the main 1-0 hotbar. These shift 1-5 keybinds will override any set shift 1-5 keybinds.
Added "Medlar" trees to tree list.
Fixed minimap closing if you hit escape with it focused.
Converted livestock manager over to a resizable window, going too narrow will hide buttons, but can make the window shorter in general now.
Slight change to how windows save position, mostly this allows containers to not open on top of eachother making it easier to see contents.
Switched quest helper window over to the window type that saves position and can be locked.
Added toggle to "Control settings" to disable pick forage keybind from opening/closing gates.
Fixed livestock manager not working for languages other than English
Large update to translation file adding new labels/button strings for translation.
Broke out horses from "hide animals" toggle into their own "hide horses" toggle.
Changed proximity aggro to not target domestic horses. 
Merged boshaw change to make certain windows "hideable." Selecting this button on the window will make the frame and background transparent unless the window has your mouseover focus. Currently the list is quest log, belt, and minimap. Accepting ideas for more windows to add this functionality to. Button looks horrible on default theme, not sure what to do about that - Belt caption doesn't have enough space.
Added boshaw change that elevates mob types 5 points if theyre in water. Should make everything easier to pick up except foxes.
Added treatment display for midge bites.
~

1.00.96
Merged with Boshaw, who added locks to hotkey bars. Locked will allow you to drop things onto the bar, but not move/remove them.
~

1.00.95
Added "ardclient" theme and set it to default. Not 100% identical to the old style, but moderately close. 
Movement queue from the Ctrl+A map should now be somewhat accurate at different zoom lives, albeit the line is still not accurate.
Added toggle to ui settings to increase font size of quality and quantity fields.
Fixed filter window not having the help button on sloth theme.
Actual fix for follow cam now, sorta, disable "no black load screens" if you want to use follow cam - sorry.
~

1.00.94
Rollback on follow cam "fix" because it slowed every camera's loading down, fuck follow cam.
~

1.00.93
Added quest helper window, alt Q by default.
Made textentry boxes ignore keypresses including ctrl and alt so that keybinds will continue to work.
Toggle chat keybind will now hide chat if chat has focus, unhide chat if its hidden, and focus chat if unhidden but not focused. Should be a cleaner way to interact with it.
Numpad hotbar when in "Grid" style will now match the layout of the actual numbpad. Let me know if this causes new issues.
Various bugs with Miner Alert should be fixed, mute button should work again, as well as miner alert not continuing to run once closed. 
Added cave centipede hide option, should also enable th em to be picked up with Q
Hand slots widget now displays equipped quality.
Windows will now ignore mousedown clicks from mouse4/mouse5. 
Fixed a Z axis issue when using follow cam and entering/leaving buildings. The fix will disable the "no black load screens" for follow cam, not sure another way around that.
Added some basic unstucking to farmer bot to navigate around beehives and such. 
~

Toggle chat keybind will now reopen the chat window if it's hidden.

Implemented numpad belt, uses numberpad keys to trigger. 
Fixed feast all button eating food from study as well.
Added toggle to display options to always display long tooltips.
Added ability to lock inventory and equipped objects with ctrl right click. This will stop you from being able to accidentally left click them. Right clicks will still work.
Fixed back button on menugrid taking you out an entire level, will now just go back one page unless on page one, and then it'll go back a full level.
Merged some outdated wound stuff.
Maybe fixed unbound keybinds triggering from anything. This could potentially have other implications I guess? Let me know if anything weird happens.
Added debug crash write outs to the client folder to help with troubleshooting. They simply write the stacktrace in a text file that can be sent or copied to me whenever.
Added display setting selectors for water and deep ocean colors.
Added movement queing, alt click in the world, alt click on Ctrl+A map, and shift click on minimap. 
Made the magic confirmation window popup for magic that is cast from a hotbar.
Added animation disable toggles for visitor flags and the new flag pole.
Added toggle in ui settings to disable the escape key closing UI windows, and ensured that escape will never close the chat window.

Made F1-F12 supersede all text entry boxes.
Added ui settings toggle to disable calendar at the top of the screen.

Turned deep ocean a much darker and more obvious color to help people avoid it.
Added mousewheel zoom to the Ctrl+A expanded map.
Added rainbow shells to the alarm list.
Fixed potential crash caused by recent alarm change, all alarms with incorrect values should be set to default upon login.
Added sliders to set custom "daylight" filter, the CTRL+N functionality. This will allow you to customize your permanent daylight color. In display settings.
Added alarm for combat initiation, off by default. To enable find the alarm in combat settings and select an alarm. 
Fixed the ghostbusters sound effect file.
Adding new list to "Control settings" of items to disable the shift+right click functionality on. This is to prevent accidentally emptying steel crucibles or smelters and such.

Added moon phases to the server time display under the Calendar. 
Added turnips to trough filler.

1.00.86
Fixed minimap clicks having offset applied twice.
Added seperate toggle to draw circles around all Kin, separate from drawing circles around Party. Also under display options.
Publicized flax bot and the improved pepper bot, go nuts. Fuck Jorb. Flax bot is best used on wide open fields with lots of empty barrels, by a farmer with crawl speed left on 24/7. Will continously harvest flax, replant highest quality, and barrel leftover seeds generating near-infinite animal fodder while also raising flax quality continuously.
Added toggle to disable village idol smoke.
Added toggle to disable steel crucible smoke (I don't know if this works, I don't have steel crucibles.)
Made target switching a keybind.

Rewrote the "draw circle underneath player" logic to fix a performance issue it cuased.
Added toggle in display settings to put a green circle around pavement stranglevines, to highlight them for destruction.
Added video option to disable tar kiln smoke animation, should increase performance if turned on. 
Added checkbox to timer window to automatically resort timers every 30 seconds based on time remaining.
Added "setSpeed" and "maxSpeed" functions to PBotAPI, should allow you to set player speed and retrieve the current max player speed for a given terrain (I think)
Fixed tooltips being off location when the map was manually offset. 
Added candleberry to the minimap alarm list.
Converted quest widget into a movable window that can be placed anywhere.
Added percentage text to the middle of "Buff" icons to show their percentage without needing to hover over them.
Changed the cave-in warning dust animation to persist for 30 minutes now, up from whatever tiny number it used to be by default. Should make it a little easier to keep track of cave-in tiles.
Fixed bats showing a danger radius when dead, could potentially break other danger radiuses, let me know if it does. 
~
